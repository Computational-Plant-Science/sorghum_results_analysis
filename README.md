# Sorghum Trait Analysis Pipeline

This project processes and visualizes sorghum root trait data using a Dockerized pipeline. It supports:

- Combining and cleaning raw Excel data
- Scaling and outlier correction
- Plotting trait comparisons (bar, line, heritability, etc.)
- Exporting plots as interactive HTML or static PNG (via Kaleido)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Docker Image

```bash
./pipeline.sh
```

### 2. Run a Plot Script

```bash
./pipeline.sh plot_heritability.py
```

All paths should use the** **`/srv/data/...` form inside the container. This mounts your local** **`./data/` directory.

## Inputs

Place your input files in the `data/` directory before running the pipeline:

* `data/raw/`
  ↳ Directory of raw trait files `*.xlsx`. These will be combined and cleaned.
* `data/meta.xlsx`
  ↳ Metadata file mapping `plot_number` to `Genotype `and `Condition`.
* `data/cleaned.xlsx`
  ↳ Generated by the cleaning step; used as input for all plotting scripts.
